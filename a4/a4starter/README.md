Notes:
Please have the app at full screen (i.e. at least full height) when testing. I noticed that when I used the Pixel C emulator with the screen size (emulator size) too small then there are some tracking issues but it seems to work fine when it is scaled to the screen size of the laptop.

Also, panning is enabled when all of (erase, pen, highlighter) toggles are off.
